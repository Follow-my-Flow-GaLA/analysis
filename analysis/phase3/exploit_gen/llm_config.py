1. Make this code syntactically correct;
2. Make sure `console.log(67890)` is executed especially when `function(){}` is just declared and not called;
3. Remember you can take advantage of the computed property names feature e.g. `{[console.log(67890)]:1}`, and self-invoked functions;
4. MyString should not appear in the answer;
5. You should not drop or miss any unclosed single quote or double quotes in the given code;
