# Follow My Flow: Unveiling Client-Side Prototype Pollution Gadgets from One Million Real-World Websites

In this paper, we design a dynamic analysis framework, called GaLA (\underline{Ga}dget \underline{L}ocator and \underline{A}nalyzer), to automatically detect client-side prototype pollution gadgets among real-world websites, and implement an open-source version of GaLA. Our key insight is to borrow existing defined values on non-vulnerable websites to victim ones where such values are undefined, thus guiding the property injection to flow to the sinks in gadgets.
